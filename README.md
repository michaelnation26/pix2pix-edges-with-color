# pix2pix-edges-with-color

Extension of the [pix2pix (edges2shoes) implementation](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix).

In the original implementation, the input image is black and white, only containing the edges of the shoe. After the GAN model is trained, there is no way to control the color of the output image.

In this project, color is added to the input image during training. Resulting in a generator model where the color in the output image corresponds to the color in the input image.

### THE CODE FOR THIS PROECT IS COMPLETE. THE WRITEUP FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE ADDED SOON.
